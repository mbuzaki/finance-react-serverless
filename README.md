# finance-react-serverless
<h3> First Things First </h3>
Clone the repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/robscott1/finance-react-serverless.git</code>

<h3>Install Amplify</h3>
Next, use <code>npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli</code>

<h3>Configure Amplify</h3>
After that, hit <code>amplify configure</code> and follow the prompts
You will likely use your IAM console-- give yourself administrator permissions

I will look more into different environments on **Amplify**, there may be another way to *collaborate*.
  
<h3>Alas</h3>
<code>npm install</code> one more time for good measure and then <code>npm start</code>

<h3>Happy hacking</h3>
