Lets take a jab at using **markdown**

First, clone the repository: `git clone 

Next, use `npm install @aws-amplify/cli`

After that, hit `amplify configure` and follow the prompts
You will likely use your IAM console-- give yourself administrator access

Once that is all done, hit `amplify init` and choose the same environment. Any changes will have to be done through pull requests. I will only accept pull requests that have changes on the front-end.

I will look more into different environments on **Amplify**

Lastly, `npm install` one more time for good measure and then `npm start`

Happy hacking
