<h3> First Things First </h3>
Clone the repository

<h3>Install Amplify</h3>
Next, use <code>npm install @aws-amplify/cli</code>

<h3>Configure Amplify</h3>
After that, hit <code>amplify configure</code> and follow the prompts
You will likely use your IAM console-- give yourself administrator access

Once that is all done, hit <code>amplify init</code> and choose the same environment. Any changes will have to be done through pull requests. I will only accept pull requests that have changes on the front-end.

I will look more into different environments on **Amplify**, there may be another way to *collaborate*.
  
<h3>Alas</h3>
<code>npm install</code> one more time for good measure and then <code>npm start</code>

<h3>Happy hacking</h3>
