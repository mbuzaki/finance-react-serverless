# finance-react-serverless
<h3> First Things First </h3>
<p>First, clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/robscott1/finance-react-serverless.git`</p>

<h3>Install Amplify</h3>
<p>Next, use `npm install @aws-amplify/cli`</p>

<h3>Configure Amplify<h3>
<p>After that, hit `amplify configure` and follow the prompts
You will likely use your IAM console-- give yourself administrator access

Once that is all done, hit `amplify init` and choose the same environment. Any changes will have to be done through pull requests. I will only accept pull requests that have changes on the front-end.

I will look more into different environments on **Amplify**, there may be another way to *collaborate*.</p>
  
<h3>Alas<h/3>
`npm install` one more time for good measure and then `npm start`

<h3>Happy hacking</h3>
